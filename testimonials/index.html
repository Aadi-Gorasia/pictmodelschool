                            This email is to thank you for the awesome field trip that the school arranged for the learners. All the kids had wide smiles as they came back home. <br>
                            Since she is back, Swarali only has fond memories to talk about the field trip. Be it the travel, food, their stay, Monteria village, or the DJ night, she only has lovely memories to talk about. Most of the kids are already looking forward to their field trip next year :) The entire trip right from the orientations to their pick-up from school yesterday was very well organized and executed. Also, the educators and staff provided us with photos and updates on the WhatsApp group regularly. <br>
                            Thank you to the entire staff at PICT, the educators and staff who accompanied them and took good care of all the learners. Please convey our gratitude to the Indian Odyssey team for the entire experience. Looking forward to many more such memories!!!!</p>

                            I hope such trips continue to be a part of the school activities. It would also be great if the children had a sports day annually too.<br>

                        <p class="testitext">Dear Ma'am,<br>Today we would really like to appreciate all the efforts put in by you and your team in arranging the overnight trip to Monteria Village. This was his first experience away from family but with the known PICT family which was so filled with excitement and fun that he has all the good things and joyful moments to share with us. Never seen him so cheerfully revisiting the travel memories. All your effort is translating to obvious improvements in our child. The students of this academy can never tell their stories without including the great role you have played in their lives. I want to appreciate the Principal Ma'am and staff for their steadfastness to see the students excel not only academically but also focus on their overall well-being. The recently well-organized overnight trip for Grade 6 to Monteria resort was a perfect example of great project management, be it from requirement gathering, planning, resource alignment, risk analysis, on-field end-to-end support with superb flawless execution along with timely updates to the parents!
                            <br>Thank you, Principal Ma’am and all PICT teachers/staff for everything you do, we are forever grateful for all the time and effort you put in, for this school to continue getting better. You have added a great memory to our child’s memory bank which he will cherish forever!<br>
                            Looking forward to having such active engagements with them in the future!</p>

                        <p class="testitext">Dear Madam<br>
                            It is a privilege to have our child go to PICT. It was exemplified by the amount of planning and preparation that had gone into and behind the scenes. More importantly, balancing safety and enjoyment is quite a tightrope and I must acknowledge that this was perfectly balanced by each one of the staff at PICT. There were times when children were quite tired of the unending briefings and there was a lot of commotion in WhatsApp groups expressing angst and displeasure, but with the advantage of hindsight, I would be the first to admit that each act by the school, each diktat and each guideline issued, were singularly responsible to make the trip a safe environment for the learners.<br>
                            The choice of location and the depth of information given to the learners is also commendable. When Anagha excitedly pointed out that we had skipped Nathmal ki Haveli on our trip earlier, and the details around how its twin architects went about decorating the haveli until the two met, or the Shringar Chowk or the 300 Jalis inside Mehrangarh, it really is a testament to how learning should be conducted in a school. Without rambling further, I would like to end this note with a deep sense of appreciation and also urge you to ignore any snide comments or negative feedback from any quarter because the only thing that I can say with certainty, is that a trip of such a magnitude couldn’t have been possible without a very determined set of folks at the helm providing unwavering direction.</p>

This is an appreciation note on behalf of Aarav Jain's grandmother who attended the event today.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank Principal ma'am and educators for their efforts in planning and executing the Grandparents day today so well.
Aarav's grandmother was overwhelmed with the affection and courtesy showcased right from entrance in school till the end of event. 
This is truly inspiring and value creator for the young learners. Also, we would like to thank Shilpa Ma'am (Orion Class teacher) for providing Aarav an opportunity to showcase his public speaking skills. 
His grandmother felt very happy to watch him speak with confidence. Thanks once again for your efforts, we are proud to be part of PICT community :-) <br> Regards,

No chaos, helpful support staff, approachable at all times directing grandparents.
Angad's grandparents are looking forward to come again next year to enjoy this exclusive time that has been a memorable one for them. <br> Regards,
